For simple model such as logistics regression, the tunning time is relatively low even the searching space is quite large. However, for SVC on the other hand, this is a much intense and computational heavy algorithm which took more than 1 hours to run for my initial search space. Therefore, I had to reduce the dimension of the search space which ended up with 1m41 running time. \n",

By doing so, we will have a more balance data so algorithm will have learn the feature in the balance fashion. Other things we could consider is ensemble modling such as XGboost and Random Forest as those algorithm is more robust than Decision Tree. Third, we could also consider tunning the parameters with greater range. Especially for class_weight parameter that we should consider carefully on putting more weight on minority over the majority class."
